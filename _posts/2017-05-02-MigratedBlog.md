#### WordPress, it's not you... it's me...

I have been running my blog on a dedicated webhost with WordPress for sometime now... lately I have struggled to keep up with blogging and maintaining my site.

My yearly renewal for my web host recently came up, and for some reason, over the years my price went from ~$90 (per year) to a new high of about $220. This was the final straw for me as I really was not a frequent blogger and for me... Wordpress just became a pain to use and maintain...

I am happy to announce, I am fully migrated to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) - I'm already very happy with the move and am actually excited to get back into blogging.

If you haven't looked at: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) well, it's pretty great! Enabling Pages for one of your GitHub repositories will enable a hosted instance of Jekyll for the repository.  

Haven't heard of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Well here is the summary from their website:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.


I really like to think of it as "Blogging as Code"... To write a new post, I simply need to author a new Markdown file, and then push it to my GitHub Pages repository, boom! blog posted. It is also highly customizable, I built the Theme and Template of this site myself utilizing [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) which was fun to learn! honestly though, I still have a lot of tweaking but it's coming along!

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), *like* WordPress does have many public themes available as well, so if you don't feel like tweaking style sheets and HTML templates, you really don't have to. You will notice that MANY GREAT blogs out there utilize the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme - I would suggest taking a look at this if you are interested in getting started. GitHub also has some great [Tutorials](https://pages.github.com)... at this point, you can create GitHub Pages by simply by creating a new repo and checking a checkbox!
  
I will say that WordPress is a great platform, but if you are comfortable with using GitHub, getting into Code, and MarkDown, well it's a no-brainer! Jekyll has many advanced features for testing / maiting your website in code, the experience of working on my site and writing posts has felt very natural for me as someone who works with GIT repositories for all projects and lives in code.


If you are in Tech and don't have a website or blog... you should ABSOLUTELY create a GitHub page for yourself and get started!

Did I mention it's **free**?
