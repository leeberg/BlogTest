In the last few months I have had to rebuild my desktop / laptop computers a number of times. This exercise has had me going through the motions of reinstalling all of my favorite applications time and time again.

We have many very easy to use tools to streamline the process, such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), [Ninite](https://ninite.com), or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) but often times I have felt the need to simply keep a running tally of all the various applications that I need to use regular basis or simply cannot live without.

Simple Solution - CREATE A [GIST!](https://gist.github.com/) Below is [My GIST](https://gist.github.com/leeberg/90b74042bec27c8c65a46fd7ae2e1161) of all the various applications I install on my personal Windows workstations. It's should come in handy for future personal reference, and I hope keeping a GIST of personal applications cathches on, as I would be very interested to see all the various applications other smart folks on GitHub use.
