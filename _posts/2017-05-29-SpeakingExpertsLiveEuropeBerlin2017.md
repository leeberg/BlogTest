I am very happy to announce that I have been once again invited back to one of my favorite conferences of the year! In a few short months, I will be back in Berlin this year for <a href="http://www.expertslive.eu/" target="_blank">Experts Live Europe</a> August 23rd-25th!

The Conference, previously named "System Center Universe Europe" is once again at the <a href="http://www.bcc-berlin.de/enhttp://www.bcc-berlin.de/en" target="_blank">Berlin Congress Center</a> right off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz" target="_blank">Alexanderplatz</a> in Berlin, Germany.
