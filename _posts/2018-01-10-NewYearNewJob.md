After consulting for over 4 years the time has come for me to make a major career change.

Starting on January 22nd 2018, I will be starting a new role as a **Technical Product Manager** for [STEALTHbits Technologies](https://www.stealthbits.com/) right here in Madison, Wisconsin.

I'm excited to join a team that contains some of the brightest developers I have personally worked with in the past (such as [Adam Driscoll](http://poshtools.com)) to help build and ship some really cool cybersecurity products.

After chatting about the role and finding out that the "product" in this case aligns with my interests and is similar to products I work with today I was very interested. After getting a chance to visit the team on-site and being asking to perform a technical product demo as part of the interview process... I was sold, I knew these guys and girls were the real deal.

This role is a big change for me, a change I am greatly looking forward to. When it comes down to it, the single thing I am most excited about is the fact that I will be given the opportunity to be challenged by and improve myself in my duties as a Product Manager.

I will absolutely be continuing to blog, speak at conferences/user groups, contribute to the community, and be a Microsoft MVP so Iâ€™m not going anywhere! These sorts of activities are now even part of my job description so I will actually be more engaged and will surely be doing some really incredible things. Thanks for reading this post and I hope to have some interesting things for you on the blog soon.
