Over the past week, I have been speaking at the [Midwest Management Summit 2017 Conference](www.MMSMOA.COM), in the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This conference has a reputation for being an Excellent Conference and this year certainly lived up to those standards!

At this years MMS, I was on-stage for 6 Sessions, 1 Usergroup Presentation, and [helped produce](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_6F0YXVYAARpB_.jpg) and [participated in](https://twitter.com/adaptiva/status/864622970320420864) about a dozen Podcasts/Videos. I also [attended some fantastic sessions](https://twitter.com/ramseyg/status/864506097524256769), the speaker selection this year was a bit more selective so I was happy to be selected again and have a number of my sessions come into the "Top 10" highest rated sessions. As always [catching up with all the great folks](https://twitter.com/Savision/status/864614885124190208) I am happy to call my friends was as always a highlight of the week!

In this post, I will include links to the code and an outline of my activities at the conference this year. This year was a not-stop barrage of activity that I feel I am still recovering from but it was all worth it and hope to participate again next year!
