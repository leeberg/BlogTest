I have recently been experimenting with some of the latest and greatest cloud / tech offerings from Amazon, and have recently put together two separate videos with some of my tests / proof of concepts / experiments. One is specific to Alexa (Echo Dot) and the other is the Amazon Dash / AWS IoT Button. Both relate to Service Management with ServiceNow in their own way, enjoy!

**Alexa Skill: Proof of Concept - ITSM Personal Assistant
**I wanted to try out AWS Lambda and Alexa skills, so why not hook up Alexa to my ServiceNow ITSM Demo environment.
